# christmas-coding-challenge-2024
This project was developed within the framework of the Christmas Coding Challenge 2024, organized by Women Coding Community.

# ðŸ“… Challenge Goals
-Solve one LeetCode problem daily in Pyhton.

-Focus on a variety of topics such as arrays, strings, dynamic programming, graphs, and more.

-Document each solution with explanations and, if relevant, alternative approaches or optimizations.

# DAY 1
Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

This repository contains a Python solution to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string.

ðŸ“š Algorithm Overview
Technique: Sliding Window

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string

Space Complexity: O(k), where k is the size of the character set (e.g., English letters, digits, symbols, etc.)
